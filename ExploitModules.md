# Exploit Modules #

While it may seem relatively obvious, Inguma's Exploit [modules](ModuleCategories.md) are designed to exploit and manipulate vulnerabilities in various operating systems and software platforms. Documentation for the exploit modules only extends to a brief description. In the event that you desire a fuller understanding of how the exploit works please refer to the source code. There is also a lot of work being done with developing payloads associated with their respective exploits so for the time being just "go with the flow."

The following is an **incomplete** listing of exploit modules.
