# Brute Force Modules #

Inguma's brute force [modules](ModuleCategories.md) provide trial and error based authentication cracking for a variety of services and protocols. These are all **online** modules unlike those used for cracking offline material such as MD5 hashes and the module **rainbow** from the gather modules. Much of the documentation for these should be inherent but when applicable, examples are provided.

**An Important Note About Brute Modules**

_$INGUMA\_DIR/data/users_ and _$INGUMA\_DIR/data/dict_ are the user list and dictionary file for various brute force modules respectively. If you wish to replace the dictionary file, simply append your entries to the existing user and password lists.

The following is an **incomplete** listing of gather modules.

  * brutessh
  * brutehttp
  * brutesyb
  * sidguess
  * bruteimap
  * bruteora
  * brutesmb
  * brutepop
