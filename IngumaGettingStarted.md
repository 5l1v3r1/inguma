# Deprecation warning #

**This page can be considered deprecated.  All further progress is being done in the [Inguma official wiki](http://inguma.eu/projects/inguma/wiki/).**

# Getting Started #

Inguma is reliant on the following libraries for full functionality:

  * [Impacket](http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/impacket.html)
  * [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/Scapy)
  * [Paramiko](http://www.lag.net/paramiko/)
  * [cx\_Oracle](http://www.cxtools.net/default.aspx?nav=cxorlb)
  * [Pysnmp](http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/)
  * [Python Cryptography Toolkit](http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto)

While certain portions of Inguma may function without these libraries, it is recommended to have them in order to maximize the potential of Inguma. It should also be noted that not all modules will execute successfully without these libraries. To familiarize yourself with Inguma usage, you may want to take a look at some example [quick start](ConsoleQuickStart.md) and usage.

As Scapy provides a great deal of flexibility with Inguma, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with its functions and options to maximize this program's full potential. Unfortunately, Scapy's functionality is beyond the scope of this documentation. Please consult the man page and the [Scapy demo](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/demo.html) for additional information.
